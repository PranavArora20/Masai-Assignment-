//Array Manipulation: Tracking Daily Temperatures
//Create an array that stores the temperatures recorded over 7 days. 
// Use indexing to access the temperature for the 4th day and update it to a new value by adding 2 degrees. 
// After that, log the updated temperatures for all 7 days to the console.

let arr = [12,21,32,21,10,8,19]
arr[3]+=2
// console.log(arr)
for(let i =0;i<arr.length;i++){
    console.log(arr[i])
}
